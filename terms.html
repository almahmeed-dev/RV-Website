        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 10, 2025</p>

        <h2>Agreement to Terms</h2>
        <p>By downloading and using RepVault Pro ("the app"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use. If you do not
            agree to these terms, please do not use the app.</p>

        <h2>Use License</h2>
        <p>RepVault Pro grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the app for
            personal, non-commercial workout tracking purposes.</p>

        <h2>Restrictions</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Modify, reverse engineer, or decompile the app</li>
            <li>Use the app for any unlawful purpose</li>
            <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to app systems</li>
            <li>Transfer your license to another person</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Health Disclaimer</h2>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> RepVault Pro is a fitness tracking tool, not a medical device. The app is not
            intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Always consult a healthcare professional before starting any exercise program</li>
            <li>Listen to your body and stop exercising if you feel pain or discomfort</li>
            <li>Rep counts and performance metrics are estimates and may not be 100% accurate</li>
            <li>Do not rely solely on app data for health decisions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Accuracy of Information</h2>
        <p>While we strive for accuracy, automatic rep counting uses motion sensor algorithms that may occasionally
            miscount. You can manually adjust counts as needed. Personal record calculations and 1RM estimates are based
            on standard fitness formulas and should be used as general guidance only.</p>

        <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The app, including its design, code, and content, is owned by Mubarak Almahmeed and protected by copyright
            and other intellectual property laws.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, RepVault Pro and its developer shall not be liable for any indirect,
            incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal injury or health issues arising from exercise</li>
            <li>Loss of data or workout history</li>
            <li>Inaccuracies in rep counting or metrics</li>
            <li>Device compatibility issues</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may modify these terms at any time. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the
            new terms.</p>

        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the app at any time, without prior notice, for conduct that we
            believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users or us.</p>

        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Kingdom of Bahrain, without
            regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
